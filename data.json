        "📖 **The Vietnam Incident - 2015:**\nIn 2015, a rice farmer named Andorra, a former Vietnamese soldier from the Vietnam War, encountered a strange red dog while farming. This creature was SCP-939, though he didn't know it at the time. His son Boa, who loved dogs, ran to pet what he thought was Clifford the red dog, but SCP-939 killed him instantly.",

        "🚁 **The Foundation Response:**\nAfter Andorra's son was killed by SCP-939, he tried to call the police, but they wouldn't believe him. A Foundation helicopter arrived with Mobile Task Force members who terminated the anomalous entities. However, they also eliminated Andorra's entire family to maintain secrecy.",

        "🎯 **The Vietnamese Military Investigation:**\nBefore his death, Andorra contacted the Vietnamese Army Advisor and reported everything about the armed forces and the red creature. The Vietnamese military launched a drone to investigate, which tracked the Foundation helicopter back to Site-75 VN.",

        "🔍 **Discovery of Site-75 VN:**\nThe military tracker infiltrated Site-75 VN and discovered the Foundation was using Vietnamese citizens with death sentences as Class-D personnel for anomalous testing. All information about the tests, anomalies, and global threats was transmitted to Vietnamese military computers before the tracker was destroyed.",

        "⚠️ **The Revelation:**\nThrough this incident, the Vietnamese military learned about the existence of anomalous creatures capable of ending humanity, and that these entities exist worldwide. This marked the beginning of their awareness of the Foundation's operations and the true nature of the anomalous world.",

        "🔬 **Site-75 VN Operations:**\nSite-75 VN was documented as using Vietnamese death row inmates as Class-D personnel for dangerous anomalous experiments. The facility conducted various tests on dangerous entities that posed threats to humanity, operating under the Foundation's standard protocols.",

        "🌍 **Global Implications:**\nThe Vietnam Incident revealed that anomalous threats exist globally and that secret organizations like the SCP Foundation operate worldwide to contain these dangers. This discovery changed the Vietnamese military's understanding of global security threats.",

        "📊 **Documentation and Evidence:**\nAll Class-D personnel were documented with records of their crimes. The military tracker recorded extensive data about Foundation operations, anomalous entities, testing procedures, and containment protocols before being discovered and destroyed by Foundation security.",

        "💣 **The Bombings - Retaliation:**\nOne week after the initial incident, the Foundation bombed two Vietnamese radio facilities in retaliation. The radio stations were left in ruins and rubble. The Vietnamese military couldn't let this attack slide and sent a squadron of 100 soldiers to assault the Foundation's control room, but the mission failed due to heavy Foundation combat personnel.",

        "🏗️ **Counter-Strike Operations:**\nAfter the failed assault, the Vietnamese general began planning new strategies. Meanwhile, Vietnamese forces took down the Foundation's air defenses, anticipating a possible Chaos Insurgency intervention. Before exfiltrating, they planted C4 explosives and successfully bombed the Foundation's control room. 30 veteran soldiers participated in this retaliatory attack.",

        "🌀 **The Portal Incident - November 19, 2015:**\nOn November 19, 2015, a mysterious portal randomly appeared in Bien Hoa, Vietnam. No one knew its origin or how it manifested. From this dimensional gateway emerged a horde of zombies infected with SCP-008, creatures from an alternate dimension.",

        "🧟 **Zombie Outbreak Response:**\nPolice patrolling the area witnessed the zombie emergence and called for backup. All zombies were successfully terminated, and everyone in the area was sent to hospitals for SCP-008 infection checkups. Fortunately, no one was infected, but the portal remained active.",

        "🚨 **City Lockdown:**\nThe Vietnamese military responded by evacuating all citizens and placing the city under complete lockdown - no entry, no exit. They established a perimeter, uncertain what else might emerge from the portal while preparing for potential threats.",

        "👹 **SCP-4051's Involvement:**\nIt was later discovered that SCP-4051 was behind the entire portal incident, summoning the dimensional gateways and controlling the zombie attacks. After the initial assault, the portal disappeared, but SCP-4051 continues planning future attacks.",

        "⚔️ **Ongoing Vigilance:**\nThe Vietnamese Army remains on high alert, knowing that when the portal returns, they must be ready. This incident marked another escalation in the conflict between Vietnamese forces and anomalous threats, adding dimensional warfare to their concerns."
